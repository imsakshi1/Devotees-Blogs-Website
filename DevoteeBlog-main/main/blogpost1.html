         <p class="font1">Diwali, also known as Deepavali, is a major Hindu festival that is celebrated annually around October or November. The festival symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, good over evil, and knowledge over ignorance. It is a time of joy, happiness, and new beginnings.</p>
         <p class="font1">The celebration of Diwali lasts for five days and is celebrated by millions of Hindus, Sikhs, and Jains around the world. The festivities vary from region to region and from family to family, but the common themes of light, color, and food are present in all celebrations.The first day of Diwali is known as Dhanteras, which is dedicated to worshipping Goddess Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth and prosperity. People buy new clothes, jewelry, and utensils on this day, and light candles and diyas (oil lamps) to invite the goddess into their homes.The second day is called Choti Diwali, which is also known as Narak Chaturdashi. It is believed that on this day, Lord Krishna defeated the demon Narakasura and freed thousands of prisoners from his captivity. People light diyas and burst firecrackers to celebrate the victory of good over evil.

            The third day of Diwali is the main day of the festival and is celebrated with great enthusiasm. People decorate their homes with rangoli (colorful patterns made with colored powder) and light diyas and candles to welcome Lord Rama and Goddess Sita back to Ayodhya after their 14 years of exile. Fireworks are also a common part of the celebrations.</p>
         <p class="font1">The fourth day is called Govardhan Puja, which is celebrated to honor Lord Krishna's victory over Indra, the god of rain. People make elaborate food offerings to Lord Krishna and decorate their homes with colorful lights and flowers.

            The fifth and final day of Diwali is known as Bhai Dooj, which is dedicated to the bond between brothers and sisters. Sisters apply tilak (a mark made with vermillion) on their brothers' foreheads and pray for their well-being, while brothers promise to protect their sisters from harm.
            
            Overall, Diwali is a time of great joy and celebration for Hindus and other communities. It is a time to come together with friends and family, to celebrate the triumph of good over evil, and to welcome new beginnings with open hearts and minds.</p>
